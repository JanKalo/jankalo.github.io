Hi, I am **Jan-Christoph Kalo**, Assistant Professor at the University of Amsterdam in the [Intelligent Data Engineering Lab (INDElab)](https://indelab.org).

My research investigates how knowledge can be **represented, integrated, and accessed** across diverse modalities, languages, and structures. I work at the intersection of **language models, knowledge graphs, and databases**, exploring how we can bridge unstructured text with formal semantics to support more consistent, interpretable, and multilingual reasoning.

I am particularly interested in **public and large-scale knowledge sources** such as Wikipedia, where questions of equity, interoperability, and representation meet at scale. My work combines techniques from semantic web technologies, querying, and natural language processing to build systems that not only retrieve information, but also integrate and reason over it â€” enabling more transparent and inclusive access to knowledge.

Beyond research, I supervise MSc and PhD projects and teach databases and knowledge technologies in the Bachelor and Master programs at UvA.
