My research combines **structured** and **unstructured** data. I work on knowledge graphs, large language models, and data integration methods with the goal of improving how we access, clean, and reason with data.  

### Hybrid reasoning with Knowledge Graphs and LLMs
We integrate symbolic constraints with large language models to enable more robust reasoning.  
Focus areas: autoformalization of natural language into formal queries, constraint checking, and hybrid benchmarks.

### Multilingual inconsistencies and data integration
Studying contradictions across multilingual sources such as Wikipedia tables, and developing methods for large-scale integration.  
Work includes table alignment, factual consistency, schema mapping, and entity disambiguation pipelines.

### Data cleaning with LLMs
Using large language models for data cleaning tasks such as deduplication, normalization, and validation.  
Applications include CBS Netherlands tables and large open government datasets.

### LLMs for structured knowledge access
Exploring how LLMs can both query and substitute for structured data sources.  
This includes Text2SQL/SPARQL methods, structured query fallback for QA, and studying when LLMs can act as knowledge bases or databases compared to symbolic systems.

### Information extraction
Building knowledge graphs from text and semi-structured data.  
I work on extracting entities, relations, and events, and linking them into large-scale resources for downstream reasoning tasks.
