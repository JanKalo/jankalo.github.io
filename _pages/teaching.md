### Modern Databases (UvA)
I teach the **Modern Databases** course in the Bachelor program at the University of Amsterdam. The course covers data modeling, query languages, and hands-on practice with relational and modern database systems.

### Thesis supervision
I have supervised more than **40 BSc and MSc theses** across topics in databases, knowledge graphs, and natural language processing.  
I am always open to supervising motivated students who are interested in my research areas â€” especially projects at the intersection of **knowledge graphs, large language models, and data integration**.
