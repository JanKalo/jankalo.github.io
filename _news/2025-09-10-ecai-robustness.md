Our paper on the robustness of deductive reasoning with LLMs was accepted at ECAI 2025; presentation coming soon. See the entry on the publications page: [/publications/#hoppe2025investigating](/publications/#hoppe2025investigating).

Short description: We study how small prompt and input variations affect deductive reasoning, analyze common failure modes, and outline an evaluation setup for robustness.
